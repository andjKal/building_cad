# building_cad

## Introduction
QGIS plugin developed by Kalundborg Municipality for digitization of buildings from two known reference points such as cadastral boundaries.

The plugin has been tested on QGIS versions 3.16 to 3.36.1 and work with these versions of QGIS. The plugin is still undergoing development.
